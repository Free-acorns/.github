# Free Acorns

This is a loose organization that allows members to experiment with GitHub to create, maintain, fork, merge, and even publish Open Educational Resources. 

At this point, membership of this organization is by individual approval or invitation. If you are interested in joining this organization, please email Tak Auyeung first.

For member general discussions, please use the [organization discussions](https://github.com/orgs/Free-acorns/discussions).

## What is Free Acorns about?

Free Acorns is a GitHub organiation to house repositories and projects related to OER efforts. Participation is strictly individual and by choice. There is no institution involvement.

Free Acorns has two primary objectives. The one is to actually house OER content. GitHub has a reasonable renderer of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), and GitHub also supports a web-based editor/previewer for Markdown files. This lowers the energy barrier to get started with OER authoring, cloning, and forking.

The other primary objective of Free Acorns is to examine the feasibility of using GitHub to organize OER content in an organization scale (versus a personal scale).

## How the use of GitHub align with OER

GitHub is not just a platform originally intended for revision control of source code based on a toolset called `git`. `git`, like its predessessors, such as `cvs`, `git` facilitates a few key actions:

* Clone: to copy a version of a repository to a local computer.
* Commit: to mark a number of files as revised.
* Push: to locally committed files to the repository.
* Pull: to integrate changes made to a repository to a local copy that is being revised.
* Fork: to create a new branch of a repository, each branch has its own series of versions.
* Join: to merge two branches into one, integrating the revisions.

Of course, this is just a superficial summary of the key actions of `git`. These actions are important to a self-sustaining community of OER participants:
