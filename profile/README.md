## What is Free Acorns about?

Free Acorns is a GitHub organiation to house repositories and projects related to OER efforts. Participation is strictly individual and by choice. There is no institution involvement.

Free Acorns has two primary objectives. The one is to actually house OER content. GitHub has a reasonable renderer of [MarkDown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), and GitHub also supports a web-based editor/previewer for MarkDown files. This lowers the energy barrier to get started with OER authoring, cloning, and forking.

The other primary objective of Free Acorns is to examine the feasibility of using GitHub to organize OER content in an organization scale (versus a personal scale).
